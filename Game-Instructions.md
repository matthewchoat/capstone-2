## Game Instructions

Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file.  The instructions should be clear enough for any non-technical computer user to understand and follow.

Welcome to the Treetris experience:

Click the Start button to begin the game. Use the Arrow keys (Up, Left, Down, & Right) to move and rotate the falling blocks. Press the Spacebar to drop a piece to the bottom instantly.

Your goal is to clear full rows of wood blocks. Don't let the blocks stack too high or it's game over! 

As you clear lines, the level will increase and the game speed will get faster.

Understand the different tetrominoes. In this game, there are seven different types of tetrominoes:
- I-blocks are useful for getting 'Tetris', that is competing four lines at once.
- O-blocks for filling large gaps.
- L-blocks for filling medium-sized holes.
- J-blocks face the opposite direction as L-blocks.
- S-blocks for filling small holes.
- Z-blocks face the opposite direction as S-blocks.
- T-blocks are also for filling small holes.
